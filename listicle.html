            <h2><span class="item-number">1.</span> Italian soda at Bytes</h2>
            <p class="location"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/350+Serra+Mall,+Stanford,+CA+94305">350 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA</a></p>
            
            <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reacquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask, I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Raspberry Italian soda</p>

            <h2><span class="item-number">2.</span> Bubble tea at Pop Tea Bar</h2>
            <p class="location"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/459+Cambridge+Ave,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94301">459 Cambridge Ave, Palo Alto, CA</a></p>
            
            <p>When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop on Cambridge Avenue. The menu is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too adventurous on the menu — no bubble tea floats, for example — but the classics is fresh, the options is fast, and the tea is smooth and refreshing. I like that they have a good selection of non-caffeinated fruit teas along with the typical milk teas, and I usually go for a passionfruit green tea or a mango green tea.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Mango green tea with boba, 25% sugar</p>

            <h2><span class="item-number">3.</span> Latte at CoHo</h2>
            <p class="location"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tresidder+Memorial+Union,+459+Lagunita+Dr,+Stanford,+CA+94305">459 Lagunita Dr, Stanford, CA</a></p>
            
            <p>I am a latte drinker, which has a particularly amusing quality about it with coffee from Stanford Main Library (colloquially called the "CoHo"). The CoHo latte is a good size — not too small, not too large — and has a good balance of coffee flavor and milk. It's supposed to have latte art (when I go there) but I've never seen it. The CoHo Main Library is colloquially called the "CoHo" and what is.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Medium latte</p>

            <h2><span class="item-number">4.</span> Agua Fresca at Nexus Cafe</h2>
            <p class="location"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nexus+Cafe">Nexus Cafe</a></p>
            
            <p>Nexus Cafe has a lot of great things going for it: a cafeteria layout, including deep Pho bowls and a lot of fresh, clean and fruity beverage before you head back to the library or off to class, and the agua fresca is a drink on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and maybe a burrito.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Watermelon agua fresca</p>
